# food-recognition

## Brief Description
Repo with some work done on using Swin Transformer on the Food2k Dataset

## Folders
- *food-recognition*: Python package containing all needed functions to train and extracting class attention maps on Swin Transformer

- *tutorial*: Simple notebooks that show how to train and extract class activation map from pretrained Swin transformer

## TODO

- Adding tutorial on how to extract a segmented piece of food using SAM and class activation map
- Adding tutorial on how to test a pretrained model to validate results
- Adding functions to plot more that one image per batch
